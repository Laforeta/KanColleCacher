KanColleCacher
====================


What is this?
-----------------------

KanColleCacher.dll is a plug-in for KanColleViewer (KCV) to prove persistent and easily manageable cache files. 

The main benefits of using this plug-in is reduced data usage and faster game loading as cache files are no longer randomly flushed by the browser.

In addition, this tool can also be used to change the graphics and sound as they appear in the game. Please read the instructions thoroughly and use this function responsibly. 


Version Support
-----------------------
* The latest test release is v2.1.0
* Tested to be fuly compatible with v3.3 through to v3.6 of the main KCV branch, as well as yuyuvn's KCV v3.7 build.
* It does NOT appear to function properly with pre-3.0 versions of KancolleViewer, avoid this plugin if you are still on an older version of KCV. 
* Compatibility with future versions of KancolleViewer is not guaranteed as the underlying code base may change.
