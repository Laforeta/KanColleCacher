What is this?
-----------------------

KanColleCacher.dll is a plug-in for KanColleViewer (KCV) to prove persistent and easily manageable cache files. 

The main benefits of using this plug-in is reduced data usage and faster game loading as cache files are no longer randomly flushed by the browser.

In addition, this tool can also be used to change the graphics and sound as they appear in the game. Please read the instructions thoroughly and use this function responsibly. 


Version Support
-----------------------
* The latest test release is v2.2.2.38
* There are currently two branches targeting two major versions of KancolleViewer. A self-contained version for KCV 3.8.x as well as a slightly more complex version for the 4.x branch. 
* Compatibility with pre-3.8 versions of KCV has been discontinued. If you are still on one of the earlier builds please consider upgrading to at least 3.8.2 which contains important bug fixes.
